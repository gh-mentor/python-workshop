# Python Producer-Consumer Example

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the producer-consumer pattern using Python. The producer generates items and puts them into a shared queue, while the consumer retrieves and processes these items. This pattern is commonly used in concurrent programming to manage the flow of data between threads.

## Project Structure

```
python-producer-consumer
├── src
│   ├── producer.py       # Implementation of the producer class
│   ├── consumer.py       # Implementation of the consumer class
│   └── __init__.py       # Marks the src directory as a package
├── tests
│   ├── test_producer.py  # Unit tests for the producer class
│   ├── test_consumer.py  # Unit tests for the consumer class
│   └── __init__.py       # Marks the tests directory as a package
├── requirements.txt       # Lists project dependencies
└── README.md              # Documentation for the project
```

## Getting Started

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To execute the producer and consumer, you can run the following command:

```
python src/producer.py
python src/consumer.py
```

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests for the producer and consumer classes, use the following command:

```
pytest tests/
```

## Conclusion

This project serves as a basic example of the producer-consumer pattern in Python. It can be extended and modified to suit more complex use cases and requirements.
